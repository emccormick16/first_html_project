                The MVP long ago decided, <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/j/judgeaa01.shtml">Aaron Judge</a> is taking pennant-race matters into his own very large hands. He took over the Subway Series, hitting early stage-setting home runs in both games, driving in half the runs Tuesday in Game 2, lifting the Yankees out of their inexplicable funk and restoring faith in a team that’s suddenly looking like a powerhouse again.

                Judge’s latest work of art landed 453 feet from home plate, a 115 mph drive deep into the lower deck in left field at Yankee Stadium. Now let’s see how far he can carry this Yankees ballclub that started to show a few too many cracks over the past month plus.

            Single-handedly, he turned a depression into a celebration almost as fast as he turned around replacement starter Taijuan Walker’s 3-and-2, fourth-inning offering. Judge is back on pace to top Roger Maris’ record, the Yankees lead seems pretty secure and all is right in The Bronx, at least for the moment.
