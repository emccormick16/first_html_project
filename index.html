          The MVP long ago decided,
          <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/j/judgeaa01.shtml"
            >Aaron Judge</a
          >
          is taking pennant-race matters into his own very large hands. He took
          over the Subway Series, hitting early stage-setting home runs in both
          games, driving in half the runs Tuesday in Game 2, lifting the Yankees
          out of their inexplicable funk and restoring faith in a team that’s
          suddenly looking like a powerhouse again.

          Judge’s latest work of art landed 453 feet from home plate, a 115 mph
          drive deep into the lower deck in left field at Yankee Stadium. Now
          let’s see how far he can carry this Yankees ballclub that started to
          show a few too many cracks over the past month plus.

          Single-handedly, he turned a depression into a celebration almost as
          fast as he turned around replacement starter Taijuan Walker’s 3-and-2,
          fourth-inning offering. Judge is back on pace to top Roger Maris’
          record, the Yankees lead seems pretty secure and all is right in The
          Bronx, at least for the moment.
